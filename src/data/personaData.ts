    name: "Curated Creator",
    description: "Your feed is your gallery, your thoughts a carefully-composed caption. You believe in aesthetics with intention. Whether it's a thought-provoking Note or a perfectly color-graded Post, you live for expression that lingers. If it's not meaningful, it's not making it to your timeline. You probably save drafts for days. Others come to your profile to admire, not scroll."

  {
    name: "Fleeting Snapper",
    description: "You thrive in the now. Stories, Reels, Status updates — your world lives and vanishes in 24 hours. You don't need permanence; you need punch. Your digital vibe screams 'catch me if you can,' and your friends never know whether to laugh, cry, or screenshot. You're playful, spontaneous, and always on the move — and your archive? Doesn't exist."
  },
  {
    name: "Thoughtful Commentator",
    description: "You don't post for likes — you post to stir the pot (in the smartest way). You live in Threads, drop essays in Comments, and turn Notes into poetry. A digital philosopher at heart, you treat the internet like a seminar room. Others scroll; you engage. Some call it too deep — you call it Tuesday."
  },
  {
    name: "Social Butterfly",
    description: "You're the first to react, the fastest to DM, the one who always 'likes' before the post even loads. Your energy is unmatched and your notifications never sleep. You treat platforms like digital dinner parties: bounce from profile to profile, sprinkle a compliment, toss a meme, start a group chat. You're the glue, the gossip, the glitter."
  },
  {
    name: "Quiet Observer",
    description: "You're online, but you're not about to tell anyone. You scroll in peace, rarely post, and save content like it's currency. You like to know what's going on — without being part of it. Your reactions are minimal, but your memory is sharp. You're the soft watcher in the corner of the digital room, quietly absorbing everything."
  },
  {
    name: "Real-Time Connector",
    description: "You light up when things are live. Whether it's a stream, a spontaneous status update, or an unfiltered video — you want to be in the moment as it unfolds. You don't care for edits or aesthetics. You crave connection that feels raw, unscripted, and honest. You're not 'posting content.' You're having a moment — and everyone's invited."
